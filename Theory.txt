ChatGPT said:
Thanks for your patience! Here's a line-by-line explanation in simple words of the code in your Ass2_DL_DNN_IMDB.ipynb file. The notebook builds a Deep Neural Network for sentiment analysis using the IMDB movie review dataset.

üì¶ 1. Import Libraries and Dataset
python
Copy
Edit
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import imdb
import numpy as np
Loads the IMDB dataset which has movie reviews labeled as positive or negative.

numpy helps with numerical tasks.

üìä 2. Set Parameters and Load Data
python
Copy
Edit
max_words = 10000
max_sequence_length = 900

(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = imdb.load_data(num_words=max_words)
Only keep the 10,000 most common words.

Limit each review to 900 words.

x_train, y_train: training data and labels (0 = negative, 1 = positive)

x_test, y_test: testing data and labels

üßº 3. Preprocess the Text Data
python
Copy
Edit
from tensorflow import keras

x_train = keras.preprocessing.sequence.pad_sequences(x_train, maxlen=max_sequence_length)
x_test = keras.preprocessing.sequence.pad_sequences(x_test, maxlen=max_sequence_length)
Reviews are of different lengths.

This step pads shorter reviews with 0s or trims longer ones to exactly 900 words.

üß† 4. Build the Deep Neural Network
python
Copy
Edit
from tensorflow.keras import layers
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Dropout, Embedding, GlobalMaxPooling1D

model = Sequential()
Using Keras Sequential API to build a model layer by layer.

python
Copy
Edit
model.add(Embedding(max_words, 100, input_length=max_sequence_length))
Embedding turns word IDs into 100-dim vectors.

It helps the model understand word meaning and relationships.

python
Copy
Edit
model.add(GlobalMaxPooling1D())
Reduces the entire sequence of vectors to a single max value per feature, keeping important info.

python
Copy
Edit
model.add(Dense(32, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(16, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))
Adds fully connected layers:

Two hidden layers (32 and 16 units)

ReLU is the activation (works well in deep nets)

Final output uses sigmoid ‚Üí gives a value between 0 and 1 (probability of being positive)

‚öôÔ∏è 5. Compile the Model
python
Copy
Edit
model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='rmsprop', metrics=['accuracy'])
binary_crossentropy: best for yes/no classification

rmsprop: a popular optimizer

Track accuracy during training

üöÄ 6. Train the Model
python
Copy
Edit
history = model.fit(x_train, y_train, batch_size=512, epochs=10, validation_data=(x_test, y_test))
Trains for 10 rounds (epochs) using 512 samples at a time.

Also evaluates on test data after each epoch.

üìà 7. Plot Accuracy and Loss
python
Copy
Edit
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 5))
Sets up a wide figure for side-by-side plots.

Accuracy Plot
python
Copy
Edit
plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
plt.plot(history.history['accuracy'], label='Train Acc', color='blue')
plt.plot(history.history['val_accuracy'], label='Val Acc', color='green')
Plots training and validation accuracy over time.

Loss Plot
python
Copy
Edit
plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
plt.plot(history.history['loss'], label='Train Loss', color='red')
plt.plot(history.history['val_loss'], label='Val Loss', color='orange')
Shows how the error (loss) changes during training.

python
Copy
Edit
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
Displays both plots neatly.

üìä 8. Evaluate on Test Data
python
Copy
Edit
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
print("Test Loss:", loss)
print("Test Accuracy:", accuracy)
Tests the model on unseen data and prints the result.

The last line (y_pred_probs = m) seems incomplete, possibly a mistake or the next code cell was not included.

Would you like me to complete the last part (predicting sentiment for new input), or help you enhance the model? 






 Importing Libraries
python
Copy
Edit
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import fashion_mnist
matplotlib.pyplot: Used to draw graphs and show images.

numpy: Used for numerical operations, especially with arrays.

fashion_mnist: A built-in dataset from Keras with 28x28 grayscale images of fashion items (like shirts, shoes, etc.).

2. Loading the Dataset
python
Copy
Edit
(train_x, train_y), (test_x, test_y) = fashion_mnist.load_data()
Loads the Fashion MNIST data into training and test sets.

train_x: Images for training.

train_y: Labels (what item each image shows).

test_x, test_y: Same but for testing the model.

3. Normalizing the Data
python
Copy
Edit
train_x = train_x / 255.0
test_x = test_x / 255.0
Image pixel values are between 0 and 255.

Dividing by 255 changes them to 0‚Äì1 range, which helps the model learn better.

4. Importing Model and Layers
python
Copy
Edit
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Flatten, MaxPooling2D, Conv2D, BatchNormalization, Dropout
Sequential: Lets us build the model layer by layer.

Dense: A fully connected layer.

Flatten: Turns 2D images into 1D vectors for the Dense layer.

MaxPooling2D: Reduces image size while keeping important features.

Conv2D: A convolutional layer for detecting patterns like edges or textures.

BatchNormalization: Speeds up and stabilizes training.

Dropout: Prevents overfitting by randomly turning off some neurons during training.

5. Expanding Image Dimensions
python
Copy
Edit
train_x = np.expand_dims(train_x, axis=-1)
test_x = np.expand_dims(test_x, axis=-1)
Adds a "channel" dimension to the image (28x28 becomes 28x28x1).

Required because convolutional layers expect this format.
